# Use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As our virtual casino application grows in complexity, we need a way to document important architectural decisions. These decisions often have significant implications for the project and need to be communicated effectively to current and future team members.

Without proper documentation of architectural decisions:
- New team members struggle to understand why certain technical choices were made
- Decisions may be revisited repeatedly without awareness of previous considerations
- The rationale behind architectural choices is lost over time
- There's no clear record of alternatives that were considered and rejected

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions in the project. Each ADR will:

1. Be stored in the `docs/adr` directory
2. Be numbered sequentially (e.g., `0001-distributed-tracing.md`)
3. Follow a standard template (`0000-template.md`)
4. Include the following sections:
   - Title
   - Status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
   - Context (problem statement)
   - Decision (solution chosen)
   - Consequences (trade-offs, impacts)
   - Alternatives Considered
   - References

ADRs will be created for significant architectural decisions, including but not limited to:
- Selection of major frameworks or libraries
- System-wide patterns or approaches
- Security strategies
- Performance optimization approaches
- Integration with external systems
- Data storage decisions

## Consequences

### Positive

- Improved documentation of architectural decisions
- Better onboarding experience for new team members
- Reduced time spent revisiting decisions that were already made
- Clear record of the rationale behind technical choices
- Preservation of institutional knowledge even as team members change

### Negative

- Additional effort required to create and maintain ADRs
- Potential for ADRs to become outdated if not properly maintained
- Risk of over-documenting minor decisions

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Wiki-based documentation**: While wikis provide flexibility, they often lack the structure and version control integration that ADRs provide. ADRs stored in the repository ensure that documentation evolves alongside the code.

2. **Informal documentation in various formats**: This approach lacks consistency and makes it difficult to find relevant information. The structured format of ADRs makes them easier to navigate and understand.

3. **No formal decision documentation**: This would save time initially but would lead to knowledge loss and repeated discussions about the same topics as the team evolves.
