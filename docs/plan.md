- Implement IP-based rate limiting for sensitive operations
- Conduct security audit and penetration testing

**Rationale:** These measures will protect user data and prevent common web application attacks, addressing security gaps in the current implementation.

## 3. Performance Optimization

### 3.1 Caching Strategy

**Current State:** Redis is configured but potentially underutilized for caching.

**Proposed Changes:**
- Expand Redis caching for frequently accessed data (user profiles, game states)
- Implement connection pooling for Redis
- Add tiered caching strategy (in-memory, Redis, database)

**Rationale:** A comprehensive caching strategy will reduce database load and improve response times, especially for real-time game features that require low latency.

### 3.2 WebSocket Optimization

**Current State:** WebSockets are used for real-time game updates and chat.

**Proposed Changes:**
- Optimize WebSocket message handling for high concurrency
- Implement message compression for WebSocket communication
- Add circuit breaker pattern for WebSocket connections

**Rationale:** These optimizations will improve the real-time gaming experience, especially during peak usage times, and make the system more resilient to connection issues.

### 3.3 Frontend Performance

**Current State:** JSP-based frontend with potential performance issues.

**Proposed Changes:**
- Optimize frontend assets (minification, bundling)
- Implement lazy loading for JSP fragments
- Consider migration to a modern frontend framework

**Rationale:** Frontend optimizations will improve page load times and overall user experience, addressing limitations in the current JSP-based approach.

## 4. Code Quality and Testing

### 4.1 Test Coverage Expansion

**Current State:** Basic testing structure with JUnit 5 and Mockito.

**Proposed Changes:**
- Increase unit test coverage to at least 80%
- Add integration tests for all REST endpoints

**Current State:** Basic game functionality without advanced engagement features.

**Proposed Changes:**
- Complete implementation of consecutive days tracking for daily bonuses
- Add achievement system for player engagement
- Implement tournament functionality
- Add leaderboard functionality based on chip balances

**Rationale:** These features will increase player retention and engagement by providing goals and competitive elements, addressing limitations in the current player engagement model.

### 5.2 Social Features

**Current State:** Limited social interaction capabilities.

**Proposed Changes:**
- Implement friend invitation system
- Add chat moderation features
- Implement player statistics dashboard
- Add social sharing functionality

**Rationale:** Enhanced social features will build community around the game, increasing user retention and organic growth through social connections.

## 6. Architecture Improvements

### 6.1 Code Organization

**Current State:** Standard layered architecture with some potential design issues.

**Proposed Changes:**
- Implement Domain-Driven Design for core game logic
- Refactor ChipServiceImpl to reduce method complexity
- Extract hardcoded constants to configuration properties
- Implement proper DTO validation with custom validators

**Rationale:** These architectural improvements will make the codebase more maintainable, extensible, and aligned with domain concepts, addressing potential design issues in the current implementation.

### 6.2 Error Handling

**Current State:** Basic error handling without comprehensive strategy.

**Proposed Changes:**
- Implement global exception handling with @ControllerAdvice
- Add more specific exception types for different error scenarios
- Improve error messages for better user experience
